# StockHeatMap
Data Visualization for Stock Market
## Stock Market Heat Map Visualization Project

1. Introduction

Project Goals: The aim of our project is to create an interactive stock market heat map that allows users to quickly understand market trends, sector performance, and individual stock movements.
Motivation: With the increasing complexity of financial markets, there is a need for tools that can distill vast amounts of data into understandable visual formats. Our project addresses this need by offering a comprehensive visualization of stock performance data.
Dataset: The dataset will consist of daily stock price movements, trading volumes, and market capitalization data from major stock exchanges, such as NYSE and NASDAQ.

2. Related Work

Our literature review will focus on existing financial data visualization tools, examining their design choices, functionalities, and limitations. We aim to identify gaps in current offerings and leverage insights to inform our design process.

3. Design Considerations

User Interface Design: The interface will feature a color-coded heat map, with stocks represented as tiles varying in size and color intensity based on performance metrics.
Visualization Techniques: We will implement interactive elements such as hover-over details, click-through to detailed stock information, and filtering options to view specific sectors or performance metrics.
Code Design: The project will be developed using D3.js for dynamic data visualization and Python for data processing and backend operations.

4. Expected Roles and Responsibilities

Data Analyst: Responsible for acquiring and cleaning the dataset.
Frontend Developer: In charge of creating the interactive heat map visualization.
Backend Developer: Focuses on server-side operations and data processing.
Deliverables

A fully functional prototype of the stock market heat map.
Documentation outlining the design process and justification for design choices.
A user guide explaining how to interact with the visualization tool.
